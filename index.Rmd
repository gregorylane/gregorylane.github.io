## Assistant Professor of Economics <br> American University

I am an Assistant Professor in the Economics Department at [American University](https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/). I am a development economist and my current research focuses on innovations in finance and technology, and labor markets in developing countries. I currently have research projects in Bangladesh, Kenya, and India.   

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a PhD in [Agriculture and Resource Economics](https://are.berkeley.edu/) in 2019. 

<!-- Previously, I earned a MS in Applied Economics from Cornell University and a BA in Economics and International Relations from Tufts University. I also spent four years working for Abt Associates on USAID funded development programs in South Sudan, Ghana, and Mozambique. -->
