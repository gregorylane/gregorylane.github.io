## Assistant Professor of Economics <br> American University

I will be starting as an Assistant Professor of Economics at [American University](https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/) in the Fall of 2019. 

I am graduating from UC Berkeley with a PhD in [Agriculture and Resource Economics](https://are.berkeley.edu/). My primary research area is development economics and current research focuses on innovations in finance and technology in developing countries. I am interested in using microdata, randomized experiments, and data science to explore these topics. I currently have research projects in Bangladesh, Kenya, and India.   

Previously, I earned a MS in Applied Economics from Cornell University and a BA in Economics and International Relations from Tufts University. I also spent four years working for Abt Associates on USAID funded development programs in South Sudan, Ghana, and Mozambique.
