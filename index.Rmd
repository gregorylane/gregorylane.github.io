## PhD Candidate

I am a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in [Agriculture and Resource Economics](https://are.berkeley.edu/). My primary research area is development economics and current research focuses on innovations in finance and technology in developing countries. I am interested in using microdata, randomized experiments, and data science to explore these topics. I currently have research projects in Bangladesh, Kenya, and India.   

Before attending UC Berkeley, I earned a MS in Applied Economics from Cornell University and a BA in Economics and International Relations from Tufts University. I also spent four years working for Abt Associates on USAID funded development programs in South Sudan, Ghana, and Mozambique.

I am currently on the Job Market and will be attending the AEA meeting in January 2019. My CV can be found [here](pdfs/CV_Lane_June2018.pdf) and my contact information [here](contact.html)
