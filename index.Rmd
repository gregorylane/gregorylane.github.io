<br/>

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. My current research focuses on innovations in finance and technology, and labor markets in developing countries. I am a Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research and an affiliate at J-PAL.    

Prior to joining Harris I was an Assistant Professor at American University. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a PhD in [Agriculture and Resource Economics](https://are.berkeley.edu/) in 2019. 

<!-- Previously, I earned a MS in Applied Economics from Cornell University and a BA in Economics and International Relations from Tufts University. I also spent four years working for Abt Associates on USAID funded development programs in South Sudan, Ghana, and Mozambique. -->
