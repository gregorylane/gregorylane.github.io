I am a PhD candidate in Applied Economics at UC Berkeley. My primary research area is development economics. My current research focuses on innovations in finance and technology in developing countries. I currently have research projects in Bangladesh, Kenya, and India.  

Before attending UC Berkeley, I earned a MS in Applied Economics from Cornell University and a BA in Economics and International Relations from Tufts University. I also spent three years working for Abt Associates on USAID funded development programs in South Sudan, Ghana, and Mozambique.
