#### <em> Credit Lines as Insurance: Evidence from Bangladesh </em>
**Job Market Paper**

*Abstract:*
When insurance markets are absent, theory suggests that households can use credit lines to insure themselves against adverse income shocks. However, in many developing countries access to credit in the aftermath of shocks is scarce. Microfinance institutions (MFI), which are the primary lenders in this space, reduce credit availability in these times by insisting that previous loans be repaid before new credit is made available. This is particularly damaging for poor households because other financial products such as insurance are not available. In this paper we test whether a new financial product that offers guaranteed credit access to households in times of immediate need, allows household to insure themselves against risk. To this end, we run a large scale RCT in Bangladesh with one of the country's largest microcredit institutions, BRAC. Microfinance clients were randomly pre-approved for loans that were made available to them after local flooding occurred. We find that the knowledge of pre-approved status increases households' productive investments before the flood season and improves their resiliency after a flood. This demonstrates that guaranteed credit can effectively insure households against risk, overcoming some of the barriers that have limited the adoption of formal insurance products. Furthermore, extension of this additional credit does not harm loan repayment rates or MFI profitability, suggesting that this product can be extended to millions of households already connected to microcredit networks.

#### <em> Mitigating Market Frictions by Monitoring Employees in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises: A Field Experiment in Kenya's Public Transport Sector </em>
*(with Erin Kelley, David Schoenholzer, and Peter Wagacha Waiganjo)*

*Abstract:*
This paper introduces an innovative monitoring technology among small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) in Kenyaâ€™s public transportation sector. We study the impact of providing information about employee behavior to the firm on contract structure, productivity and negative externalities. Specifically, we work with 300 minibus owners in Nairobi, Kenya fitting their vehicles with monitoring devices recording high- frequency data on productivity and safety performance of drivers. We provide owners in the treatment group with information on driver effort and output in real-time via a sophisticated mobile application. Owners in the control group are not provided with any information until the study period is over. We cross-randomize this first treatment with a second intervention at the driver level, designed ease negative externalities pro- duced by the contract structure. We directly paid treatment drivers to improve their safety performance while driving their matatu. We find that information provision in- creased firm productivity while leading to increases in both owner and driver incomes. Providing owners information on driving behavior had no effect on safety indicators, however explicit cash incentives were effective in reducing speeding and sharp braking events.
