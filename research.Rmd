#### <em> Credit Lines as Insurance: Evidence from Bangladesh </em>
**Job Market Paper**

*Abstract:*
When insurance markets are absent, theory suggests that households can use credit lines to insure themselves against adverse income shocks. However, in many developing countries access to credit in the aftermath of shocks is scarce as negatively affected households are frequently denied loans. In this paper I test whether a new financial product that offers guaranteed credit access after a shock allows household to insure themselves against risk. To this end, I run a large scale RCT in Bangladesh with one of the country's largest microcredit institutions. Microfinance clients were randomly pre-approved for loans that are made available in the event of local flooding. I show that this unique type of microcredit improves household welfare through two channels: an ex-ante insurance effect where households increase investment in risky production and an ex-post effect where households are better able to maintain consumption and asset levels after a shock. I also document that households value this product, taking costly action to preserve their guaranteed access. Importantly, extension of this additional credit improves loan repayment rates and MFI profitability, suggesting that this product can be sustainably extended to households already connected to microcredit networks.

#### <em> Mitigating Market Frictions by Monitoring Employees in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises: A Field Experiment in Kenya's Public Transport Sector </em>
*(with Erin Kelley, David Schoenholzer, and Peter Wagacha Waiganjo)*

*Abstract:*
This paper introduces an innovative monitoring technology among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Kenyaâ€™s public transportation sector. We study the impact of providing information about employee behavior to the firm on contract structure, productivity and negative externalities. Specifically, we work with 300 minibus owners in Nairobi, Kenya fitting their vehicles with monitoring devices recording high-frequency data on productivity and safety performance of drivers. We provide owners in the treatment group with information on driver effort and output in real-time via a sophisticated mobile application. Owners in the control group are not provided with any information until the study period is over. We cross-randomize this first treatment with a second intervention at the driver level, designed ease negative externalities pro- duced by the contract structure. We directly paid treatment drivers to improve their safety performance while driving their matatu. We find that information provision increased firm productivity while leading to increases in both owner and driver incomes. Providing owners information on driving behavior had no effect on safety indicators, however explicit cash incentives were effective in reducing speeding and sharp braking events.
